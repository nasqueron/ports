## Nasqueron FreeBSD ports

This port tree is the source of truth for the Nasqueron packages repository,
FreeBSD section, at https://packages.nasqueron.org/freebsd/

It contains two kind of ports:

  i.   ports submitted upstream, not yet published
  ii.  ports specific to Nasqueron infrastructure or software

Any port installed on Nasqueron servers as documented on operations repository
should exist in the FreeBSD ports repository or in this repository.

### How to add a new port
