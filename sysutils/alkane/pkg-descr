The `alkane` command allows to manage the Nasqueron PaaS Alkane,
to host PHP sites through nginx and php-fpm, and static sites
directly through nginx.

It can work in two complementary modes:

  - as a command, to allow local system administration task and debug
  - as a server, to allow components to interact with it for automation
